// This is some starter code that will build the
// graph for you, all you need to do is implement the
// DFS on it!
//
// Our solution will work as follows:
//
// For every test case, we will first read in the data
// and build the graph.
//
// Our goal is to find clusters of '-' symbols. We will build our
// graph by only adding edges between two '-' cells that are up/down
// or left/right from one another.
//
    // Then, we will look at every cell in the map. Every time
                  // we find a '-' cell that has not yet been visited by a depth
// first search, we will count that as a new star (and increase
// the number of stars by one).
//
// Once we find one pixel of the new star, we will visit every other
// cell / pixel in the image that is part of that star, using a
// depth first search (this is the part you have to do).
//
// We will repeat this process until we have checked every pixel
// in the image, at which point we will print out the number
// of stars that we counted.
