# Kattis Repository!
This repository is a (*relatively*) up-to-date collection of all the Kattis problems that I have attempted. I first began solving in mid September, 2018.

Here is a [link](https://open.kattis.com/users/alex-lewin "Alex Lewin's Kattis Profile") to my Kattis profile that lists
which problems I have completed. From here you can get the prompts and try them out yourself!

I organized the problems by language, but I separated the problems that were solved in a "Mock-Competition" setting.

Feel free to learn from (*rip off*) my solutions!
