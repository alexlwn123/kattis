# Kattis Repository!

Repository Address: https://github.com/alexlwn123/kattis 

This repository is a (*relatively*) up-to-date collection of all the Kattis problems that I have attempted. I first began solving in mid September, 2018.

Kattis is a popular online problem judge. Each file contains the solution to a single problem.

Here is a [link](https://open.kattis.com/users/alex-lewin "Alex Lewin's Kattis Profile") to my Kattis profile that lists
which problems I have completed. From here you can get the prompts and try them out yourself!

Feel free to learn from, my solutions!
